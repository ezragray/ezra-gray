I appreciate where you are going, starting from sheet music. 'Painting annotated through our attempts at description,' compared to painting that aims to be itself a notation. Does painting conflate music and score?...Thinking of a notation system for painting I try for a distinction between interpreting and translating. Knowing that notation does not perform but may be performed - it describes, and also wants to be re-animated. Sometimes, I feel like it "holds still" whatever it is my interest might be, and wrestles it from its atmosphere. There is something alchemical and bound to error in this passing between forms - how a song might cheat on its own time, cheat its disappearance.
